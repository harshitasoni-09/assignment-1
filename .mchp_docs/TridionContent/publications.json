The framework supports the Microchip's SAM family of microcontrollers.\n\nUnlike older versions of the software framework, version 4 is designed to work together with Atmel START. Atmel START is a web-based user interface, which allow the users to configure code according to their needs. The configuration is input to START’s code generator, resulting in optimal code implementing exactly the functionality configured by the user. The generated C-code is exported from START and into the user’s development environment of choice for modification and compilation.\n\nThe tight integration with Atmel START means that the ASF4 code is more tailored to the users' specification than before. For instance, instead of using C preprocessor conditional expressions to enabled/disable code blocks, disabled code blocks can be entirely removed from the project source, which results in cleaner and easier to read code. The integration into Atmel START means that software configuration is done in a much more user-friendly environment and the only configuration information loaded on the device is the raw peripheral register content, which makes the firmware image much more compact. Code generation results in smaller and faster code compared to previous versions of ASF.\n\nASF4 has many improvements compared to previous ASF versions:\n- Common set of software interfaces across different devices\n- Smaller code size\n- Easier to use","language":"en-US","product_hierarchy":"","revision_date":"11/11/2019
